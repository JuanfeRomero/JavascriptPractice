# JavascriptPractice
Here I will include practice code made in JS

## Exercises:
- **primeNumber.js** : This code shows a function that detects if any number is a prime number, then provides an array of number for testing and returns if each of those number is or isn't a prime number.
- **linkedList.js** : This code shows a way of interpreting the concept of linked lists in Javascript. It creates a Node Object with a Data and a Next Value, and a function Solution which utilizes the nodes to either add a new node to the current instanced object through recursion, or display the solution showing the current state of the node and access each of its data value. It also uses the *JSON* method *stringify* to format the node object in a more aestethic way.
- **tateti.js** : classic exportable function that defines the logic of a tictactoe game, with tests cases included, just trying to improve on the mess of chained if statements that i make when i first did this classic function. probably will try to do it even better some other time
